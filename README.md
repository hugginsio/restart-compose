# restart-compose

A webhook listener tool for automatically updating Git repositories and restarting Docker Compose stacks.

## Overview

`restart-compose` is a Go application that monitors Docker Compose stacks and provides webhook functionality for automated deployments. It reads configuration from a YAML file and integrates with the Docker API to manage container stacks.

## Features

- âœ… **Configuration Management**: Loads stack definitions from `.restart-compose.yaml`
- âœ… **Stack Validation**: Verifies that compose files exist on the filesystem
- âœ… **Docker Integration**: Connects to Docker daemon and monitors running containers
- âœ… **Stack Information**: Displays detailed information about configured stacks and their services
- ðŸš§ **Webhook Server**: (In development) Will listen for webhooks to trigger updates

## Configuration

Create a `.restart-compose.yaml` file in your working directory:

```yaml
stacks:
  - "portainer/compose.yaml"
  - "golang/compose.yaml"
```

The paths are relative to the directory containing the configuration file.

## Usage

```bash
# Run the application
go run restart-compose.go

# Or build and run
go build -o restart-compose
./restart-compose
```

## Output Example

```
Starting restart-compose webhook listener...
Found configuration file: /path/to/.restart-compose.yaml
Loaded 2 stack(s) from configuration
Connected to Docker daemon
